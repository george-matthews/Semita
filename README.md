Semita generates a historically accurate model of the Roman Republic circa 55 BC, creating fictional characters and relationships and placing them within the Cursus Honorum system of Roman political progression, taking a character-first approach to the generation process. 

The program aims to generate these personalities in the form of 'wiki'-style articles, and has been written primarily as a means to challenge the following three issues:

• Provide an alternative means of streamlining wiki creation process using grammars.
• Allow rule-based generation of characters and items for the purposes of fictional worldbuilding.
• Allows a means of automatically generating and representing historically complex structures for educational, entertainment or organisational applications.
